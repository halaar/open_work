Activity: 
Wineries! We are going to hit as many wineries as we can on Saturday Oct 1 from 9AM - 5PM 
(the hours most of the wineries are open).

I am building a list of Michelle's favorite wineries. We are lucky enough that most of these are very close to each other. 

Transportation:
 
I am renting a 15-passenger van from enterprise. I will be driving. However, I am considering asking Dennis Bisso. He is
a professional driver. Maybe if we all toss him like $20.00 and some wine?
Price $350.00
