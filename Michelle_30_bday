Activity: 
Wineries! We are going to hit as many wineries as we can on Saturday Oct 1 from 9AM - 5PM

I am building a list of Michelle's favorite wineries. We are lucky enough that most of these are very close to each other. 

Transportation:

Blockers:

We need a babysitter for Olivia. Still working on that. Angelina hasn't yet confirmed. 

I am trying to figure out how to spread out costs. Maybe break the cost of the rental amongst everyone? That would be really cheap.. maybe we would consider a limo in that case?
